# Solar Farm Expansion Data Science Project

This project aims to analyze data related to solar farm expansion using data science techniques. It includes datasets for environmental solar data and installed solar plants with 3 million budget and 3 million Kwh/a energy need.

## Data Sources :
  - Environmental solar data csv file
  - Installed solar plants data csv file

## Clustering Based on Region using Langitude and Latitude :

## For 3 Million Budget

### South - West Area is most suitable with :
  - Sunshine Hours per year = 10595 hr
  - Size Solar Farm = 11459 m²
  - Generated energy kWh/a = 3144566 kWh/a
  - South-west land price = 1821981 euro
  - solar panel setup cost per 100(1m²) * 11459 m² = 1145900 euro

### Total cost = 2967881 (2.9M)

### Which is under the budget with 3 Million euro budget we can produce 3.1 million Kwh/a where as with 2 million budget we cannot achieve the 2 million Kwh/a energy need.
